##Psalms For Worship Status Update

In 2010, I released The Book Of Psalms For Worship for iPhone and iPad. A lot has changed in almost 10 years! New devices, new APIs, and even a new programming language. In 2019, I began migrating the app to Swift. I still like Objective-C, but I might bring on additional developers or even open source the code, and the future of the platform is clearly Swift. To help with the conversion, I've been using Swiftify, which is an automatic conversion tool. I have mixed thoughts on this. On the one hand, it really helps with the dull, boilerplate code. On the other, it doesn't produce truly modern Swift that takes full advantage of the new language. You have to go back and write that yourself. This didn't surprise me, but it makes me wonder if the tool is really worth it.

In any case, I'm hoping to release the update in early 2020, followed by updates containing bug fixes and new features. Will this app still exist in another ten years? I have no idea!
